# A leap year: writing your own functions
'''
Your task is to write and test a function which takes one argument (a year) and returns True if the year is a leap year, or False otherwise.

The seed of the function is already sown in the skeleton code in the editor.

Note: we've also prepared a short testing code, which you can use to test your function.

The code uses two lists - one with the test data, and the other containing the expected results.
The code will tell you if any of your results are invalid.

    if year % 4 != 0:
        return False
    elif year % 100 != 0:
        return True
    elif year % 400 != 0:
        return False
    else:
        return True

test_data = [1900, 2000, 2016, 1987]
test_results = [False, True, True, False]
for i in range(len(test_data)):
    yr = test_data[i]
    print(yr,"->",end="")
    result = is_year_leap(yr)
    if result == test_results[i]:
        print("OK")
    else:
        print("Failed")
